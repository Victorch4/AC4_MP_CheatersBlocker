This is a tool for easily blocking cheaters in Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag.

You can use hotkeys to block cheaters even if this tool is minimized and the game is running.
For convenience, all actions are voiced using AI.

F1 - Block/Unblock all traffic for selected IP

F2 - Block/Unblock IN traffic for selected IP

F3 - Block/Unblock OUT traffic for selected IP


If a cheater joins your session, simply press F1.


This doesn't always work:
> If you join a session where a cheater is already playing, press **F2**, wait 5 seconds, and then press **F2** again. Then, press **F3**, and wait 5 seconds, and then press **F3** again. After all this, press **F1**. You'll be kicked, but the cheater will also be kicked, and the session may break. After this, immediately start a new session search, and all players from the broken session will likely connect to you. While the cheater's IP range block is active, the cheater will not be able to play in your sessions.
